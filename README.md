1. The top-row toolbar (the one with the workbenches) is FIXED, it doesn't change when switching workbenches.

2. Other toolbars are workbench-dependent.

2. You can right-click on the toolbar to hide sections of the toolbar

3. Observe how the toolbar looks when on Part Design and Sketcher and compare it to Mango jelly videos.

## Settings

1. The bottom settings are workbench settings,so you have to in the workbench to change those settings.
